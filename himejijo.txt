Criterion i Himeji-jo is a masterpiece of construction
in wood. It also combines its effective functional role
wi th great aesthetic appeal, both in the use of white-
painted plaster and in the subtlety of the relationships
between the building masses and the multiple roof layers.
Criterion iii The castle is a powerful and evocative
syrnbol of the feudalism that prevailed in Japan until the
Meiji restoration of 1868.
Criterion iv It represents the culmination of Japanese
castle architecture in wood, and preserves all its sig-
nificant features intact.
